This folder contains:
  Problem Statement file: Hackathon_2025_problem1.pdf
  Hex Code File: simpleserial_rsa-CW308_STM32F3.hex     # We observed the power trace on running this hex file
  Trace Catcher: trace_collector.py                     # This python script collected the trace
  Trace Storage: traces.csv
  rsa_response_plaintext.csv                            # This file stores the returned plaintext for each trace against the ciphertext
  CPA_attack.py                                         # The ultimate side channel attack script, which finds the key
  verification.py                                       # This script finds the plaintext against the key and varifies if the plaintext is correct or not
